---

## Cấu trúc 12 Pages (EN)

### Page 1: Cover
```
Title: Bluecore FDP
Subtitle: Financial Data Platform for CEO & CFO
         Telling the real cash flow story of your business
Badge: FINANCIAL DATA PLATFORM
Tagline: Truth > Flexibility
```

### Page 2: A Day in the Life of an SME CEO
```
Eyebrow: THE STORY
Title: A day of a CEO who doesn't know how much cash they have
Timeline:
- 7:00 AM: Yesterday's revenue was 800M VND, but how much real cash came in?
- 9:00 AM: Supplier demands 600M VND payment today. Do we have enough?
- 11:00 AM: Marketing asks for 200M VND more for ads. Approve or not?
- 2:00 PM: Accounting says 2B VND in the account — but 1.5B is held by Shopee.
- 5:00 PM: Not sure whether to approve 500M VND new purchase request.
Quote: "End of day, CEO still doesn't know how much REAL cash they can use."
```

### Page 3: 5 Cash Flow Bottlenecks
```
Eyebrow: THE PROBLEM
Title: 5 cash flow bottlenecks that Excel cannot show

01: Sales revenue is not real cash
    • Shopee/Lazada hold for 14-21 days
    • COD not yet reconciled
    • Returns not processed

02: Inventory = Dead money
    • 30% inventory is slow-moving
    • Daily storage costs
    • Nobody knows which SKU to liquidate

03: Marketing burns cash without knowing real ROI
    • Spend 100M VND on ads → 300M VND revenue
    • But COGS + logistics + returns = loss?
    • No Unit Economics

04: Receivables "look good" on paper, bad in reality
    • AR 2B VND, but 800M overdue 60+ days
    • Who needs to be called today?
    • Actual collection probability?

05: Don't know how long until cash runs out
    • What is Cash Runway?
    • Real burn rate per month?
    • When to take action?
```

### Page 4: The Cost of Not Knowing (Dark page)
```
Eyebrow: CONSEQUENCES
Title: Every day not knowing = Real money lost

Cost Cards:
- 50-100M: Decision delayed 1 week (Miss opportunity for good pricing)
- 30-80M: Losing SKU sold 1 more month (More sales = more losses)
- 20%: AR overdue 2 months (Risk of total loss if no early action)

Quote: "SME businesses don't die from wrong decisions — they die from slow decisions."
```

### Page 5: What is Bluecore FDP? (Positioning + Screenshot)
```
Eyebrow: POSITIONING
Title: Bluecore FDP is not BI — not ERP

Screenshot: CFO Dashboard

#1: Not accounting software - Serves CEO/CFO operations, not tax reporting

#3: Truth > Flexibility - No custom metric definitions, no "choosing nice numbers"
#4: Real Cash - Distinguish: Cash received / expected / locked / at risk
#5: Revenue linked to Cost - Every revenue comes with associated costs
#6: Unit Economics → Action - Losing SKU + locked cash + risk = must say STOP
#7: Today's Decision - Serve today's decision, not month-end reports
#8: Surface Problems - Don't beautify numbers, highlight issues early
#9: Feed Control Tower - FDP is the source of truth for all actions
#10: Final Test - If it doesn't help decide clearer = failure
